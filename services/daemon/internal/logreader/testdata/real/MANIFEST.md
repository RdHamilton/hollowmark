## Fixture Files

| File | Event Class | Source | PII Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `inventory_updated_2026.59.20.log` | inventory_updated | REAL — line 429, Player.log 2026-05-29 session | Sanitized: Cosmetics block removed (ArtStyle IDs), SeqId removed, Changes removed. Gem/Gold/WildCard counts are real game values (non-PII). |
| `quest_progress_2026.59.20.log` | quest_progress | REAL — line 615, Player.log 2026-05-29 session | Sanitized: questId UUIDs replaced with stable fake UUIDs (000...001, 000...002); tileResourceId and treasureResourceId stripped (internal resource pointers). locKey (quest name key), goal, progress, chestDescription are real game values (non-PII). |
| `match_completed_2026.59.20.log` | match_completed | FORMAT-CONFIRMED — format matches parser expectations for 2026.59.20 wire protocol. Current session was lobby-only (no matches played). All player identifiers are synthetic. | N/A — no real PII present. |
| `draft_pack_2026.59.20.log` | draft_pack | FORMAT-CONFIRMED — format matches parser expectations for 2026.59.20 wire protocol. Current session was lobby-only (no draft played). GRP IDs are real card IDs from MTGA card database. | N/A — no real PII present. |
| `draft_pick_2026.59.20.log` | draft_pick | FORMAT-CONFIRMED — see draft_pack note. | N/A — no real PII present. |
| `collection_updated_2026.59.20.log` | collection_updated | FORMAT-CONFIRMED — `PlayerInventoryGetPlayerCardsV3` response is a flat `{"grpId": qty, ...}` map. Collection snapshot derived from memory dump (see #224 fixture); GRP IDs are real. | N/A — GRP IDs are non-PII per ADR-041. |
| `authenticate_2026.59.20.log` | player_authenticated | CORRECTED 2026-05-31 (#336) — Real 2026.59.20 wire shape: `{clientId, sessionId, screenName}`. Previous synthetic version incorrectly invented a `userId` key and set `clientId` to a different value than `reservedPlayers[].userId`. Corrected: no `userId`/`accountId` key; `clientId` is the join key and equals the `userId` in match fixtures. All identifiers are stable fakes (ADR-041). | N/A — no real PII present. |
| `match_completed_win_2026.59.20.log` | match_completed | REAL-DERIVED 2026-05-31 (#336) — Derived from Player_capture_20260531T063410Z.log (Standard play WIN: local player teamId=1, winningTeamId=1). `clientId` fake matches auth fixture join key. Opponent userId/sessionId/playerName sanitized. | Sanitized: playerName→fake, opponent userId/playerName/sessionId→fake, real matchId→fake UUID. `clientId`/local `userId` consistent with auth fixture (join key preserved). |
| `match_completed_loss_2026.59.20.log` | match_completed | REAL-DERIVED 2026-05-31 (#336) — Derived from Player_capture_20260531T063410Z.log (Standard ranked LOSS: local player teamId=2, winningTeamId=1). `clientId` fake matches auth fixture join key. Opponent userId/sessionId/playerName sanitized. | Sanitized: playerName→fake, opponent userId/playerName/sessionId→fake, real matchId→fake UUID. `clientId`/local `userId` consistent with auth fixture (join key preserved). |

## Sanitization Record

Applied to REAL-sourced fixtures:

- **Account identifiers**: none present in extracted fields (screenName, userId, clientId, sessionId were not present in the inventory or quest payloads)
- **Quest UUIDs**: replaced with `00000001-0000-4000-8000-00000000000N` stable fakes — these UUIDs could theoretically identify the server-assigned quest instance for this account
- **Cosmetic IDs**: removed from InventoryInfo (ArtStyle entries contain ArtId integers that are cosmetic product IDs, not user-identifiable, but excluded for minimal-footprint)
- **GRP IDs in collection snapshot**: retained — confirmed non-PII per ADR-041 risk assessment
- **Gem/Gold/WildCard counts**: retained — game resource values, not personally identifying
- **Match fixtures (win/loss, 2026-05-31)**: real `clientId`/`sessionId`/`screenName`/`matchId`/opponent `userId`/`playerName`/`sessionId` all replaced with stable fakes. Join key relationship preserved: `clientId` in auth fixture == local player `userId` in match fixtures (`FAKEPLAYER0000000000000001`). Real matchIds replaced with fake UUIDs. Opponent identifiers fully synthetic.

## Session Coverage Note

The 2026-05-29 session was a lobby-only session (deck manager navigation). No matches or drafts were played, so `match_completed`, `draft_pack`, `draft_pick`, `collection_updated` (card map), and `authenticateResponse` events did not appear in `Player.log` or `Player-prev.log`. Those fixtures use FORMAT-CONFIRMED provenance — they reflect the correct 2026.59.20 wire format as validated by:
1. The working Go parser tests that pass against the existing synthetic fixtures
2. Cross-reference with the logreader package source (match.go, draft_pick.go, collection.go, inventory.go, quests.go)

The next real-session capture (when a match or draft is played) should update these fixtures to REAL provenance. The drift canary (drift_canary_test.go) is designed to fire if the format changes between now and that update.

## Refresh Procedure (ADR-041 G3)

When the drift canary fires:
1. Open MTGA and play at least one match and one draft
2. Copy `Player.log` from `~/Library/Logs/Wizards Of The Coast/MTGA/`
3. Run the Python extraction script in `docs/runbooks/fixture-refresh.md` to re-extract and sanitize
4. Replace the fixture files in this directory
5. Update this MANIFEST with the new version and date
6. Submit a PR targeting `main` with Sarah security review on the fixture files

## Fixture Files

| File | Event Class | Source | PII Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `inventory_updated_2026.59.20.log` | inventory_updated | REAL — line 429, Player.log 2026-05-29 session | Sanitized: Cosmetics block removed (ArtStyle IDs), SeqId removed, Changes removed. Gem/Gold/WildCard counts are real game values (non-PII). |
| `quest_progress_2026.59.20.log` | quest_progress | REAL — line 615, Player.log 2026-05-29 session | Sanitized: questId UUIDs replaced with stable fake UUIDs (000...001, 000...002); tileResourceId and treasureResourceId stripped (internal resource pointers). locKey (quest name key), goal, progress, chestDescription are real game values (non-PII). |
| `match_completed_2026.59.20.log` | match_completed | FORMAT-CONFIRMED — format matches parser expectations for 2026.59.20 wire protocol. Current session was lobby-only (no matches played). All player identifiers are synthetic. | N/A — no real PII present. |
| `draft_pack_2026.59.20.log` | draft_pack (Premier) | REAL 2026-05-31 (#338) — Promoted from FORMAT-CONFIRMED to REAL. Sanitized `Draft.Notify` line (the real Premier wire format MTGA emits; the old `draftPack` key was wire-drifted) from `Player_capture_premier_20260531T072112Z.log`, pack 1 / pick 1, 14 real grpIds. The `draftId` UUID is replaced with a stable fake; grpIds retained (non-PII per ADR-041). Unblocks #262's gated draft-fixture promotion. | Sanitized: `draftId` UUID → stable fake `000...03a8`. grpIds are real MTGA card IDs (non-PII). |
| `draft_pick_2026.59.20.log` | draft_pick (Premier) | REAL 2026-05-31 (#338) — Promoted from FORMAT-CONFIRMED to REAL. Sanitized `EventPlayerDraftMakePick` request line (the real Premier pick wire format; the old top-level `pickedCards` key was wire-drifted) from the same capture, pack 1 / pick 1, picked grpId `102647`. The outer correlation `id` and inner `DraftId` UUIDs are replaced with stable fakes; grpId retained. | Sanitized: outer `id` → stable fake `000...04b1`; inner `DraftId` → stable fake `000...03a8`. grpId is a real MTGA card ID (non-PII). |
| `botdraft_pack_2026.59.20.log` | draft_pack (BotDraft / QuickDraft) | REAL 2026-05-31 (#337) — Sanitized BotDraft pack envelope (`CurrentModule=BotDraft` + stringified `Payload` with capitalized keys, the real QuickDraft wire format) from `Player_capture_20260531T063410Z.log`, `QuickDraft_SOS_20260526`, pack 0 / pick 0, 14 real grpIds. BotDraft carries NO draftId — the session is keyed by EventName. grpIds retained (non-PII per ADR-041). | N/A — no PII present (no account/draft UUIDs in the BotDraft pack wire). grpIds are real MTGA card IDs (non-PII). |
| `botdraft_pick_2026.59.20.log` | draft_pick (BotDraft / QuickDraft) | REAL 2026-05-31 (#337) — Sanitized `BotDraftDraftPick` request line (stringified `request` carrying `PickInfo.CardIds`) from the same capture, pack 0 / pick 0, picked grpId `102704`. The outer correlation `id` UUID is replaced with a stable fake; grpId retained. | Sanitized: outer `id` → stable fake `000...05c1`. grpId is a real MTGA card ID (non-PII). |
| `collection_updated_2026.59.20.log` | collection_updated | FORMAT-CONFIRMED — `PlayerInventoryGetPlayerCardsV3` response is a flat `{"grpId": qty, ...}` map. Collection snapshot derived from memory dump (see #224 fixture); GRP IDs are real. | N/A — GRP IDs are non-PII per ADR-041. |
| `authenticate_2026.59.20.log` | player_authenticated | CORRECTED 2026-05-31 (#336) — Real 2026.59.20 wire shape: `{clientId, sessionId, screenName}`. Previous synthetic version incorrectly invented a `userId` key and set `clientId` to a different value than `reservedPlayers[].userId`. Corrected: no `userId`/`accountId` key; `clientId` is the join key and equals the `userId` in match fixtures. All identifiers are stable fakes (ADR-041). | N/A — no real PII present. |
| `match_completed_win_2026.59.20.log` | match_completed | REAL-DERIVED 2026-05-31 (#336) — Derived from Player_capture_20260531T063410Z.log (Standard play WIN: local player teamId=1, winningTeamId=1). `clientId` fake matches auth fixture join key. Opponent userId/sessionId/playerName sanitized. | Sanitized: playerName→fake, opponent userId/playerName/sessionId→fake, real matchId→fake UUID. `clientId`/local `userId` consistent with auth fixture (join key preserved). |
| `match_completed_loss_2026.59.20.log` | match_completed | REAL-DERIVED 2026-05-31 (#336) — Derived from Player_capture_20260531T063410Z.log (Standard ranked LOSS: local player teamId=2, winningTeamId=1). `clientId` fake matches auth fixture join key. Opponent userId/sessionId/playerName sanitized. | Sanitized: playerName→fake, opponent userId/playerName/sessionId→fake, real matchId→fake UUID. `clientId`/local `userId` consistent with auth fixture (join key preserved). |
| `botdraft_pack_2026.60.log` | draft_pack (BotDraft / QuickDraft — new format) | FORMAT-CONFIRMED 2026-06-12 (#1344, Defect 1) — New-format BotDraftDraftStatus response: `CurrentModule=BotDraft` with `Payload` as a native JSON object (not a stringified envelope). Derived from corpus catalog sample `api-response__BotDraftDraftStatus.json`. `QuickDraft_SOS_20260526`, pack 0 / pick 0, 14 grpIds. No draftId — session keyed by EventName. | N/A — no PII present. grpIds are real MTGA card IDs (non-PII per ADR-041). |
| `botdraft_pick_2026.60.log` | draft_pick (BotDraft / QuickDraft — new format) | FORMAT-CONFIRMED 2026-06-12 (#1344, Defect 1) — New-format BotDraftDraftPick request: `request` as a native JSON object (not a stringified envelope), carrying `PickInfo.CardIds`. Derived from corpus catalog sample `api-request__BotDraftDraftPick.json`. Pack 0 / pick 0, picked grpId `102473`. Outer `id` is a stable fake. | Sanitized: outer `id` → stable fake `111...4762`. grpId is a real MTGA card ID (non-PII per ADR-041). |

## Sanitization Record

Applied to REAL-sourced fixtures:

- **Account identifiers**: none present in extracted fields (screenName, userId, clientId, sessionId were not present in the inventory or quest payloads)
- **Quest UUIDs**: replaced with `00000001-0000-4000-8000-00000000000N` stable fakes — these UUIDs could theoretically identify the server-assigned quest instance for this account
- **Cosmetic IDs**: removed from InventoryInfo (ArtStyle entries contain ArtId integers that are cosmetic product IDs, not user-identifiable, but excluded for minimal-footprint)
- **GRP IDs in collection snapshot**: retained — confirmed non-PII per ADR-041 risk assessment
- **Gem/Gold/WildCard counts**: retained — game resource values, not personally identifying
- **Match fixtures (win/loss, 2026-05-31)**: real `clientId`/`sessionId`/`screenName`/`matchId`/opponent `userId`/`playerName`/`sessionId` all replaced with stable fakes. Join key relationship preserved: `clientId` in auth fixture == local player `userId` in match fixtures (`FAKEPLAYER0000000000000001`). Real matchIds replaced with fake UUIDs. Opponent identifiers fully synthetic.

## Session Coverage Note

The 2026-05-29 session was a lobby-only session (deck manager navigation). No matches or drafts were played then, so several fixtures started as FORMAT-CONFIRMED. A subsequent 2026-05-31 Premier-draft capture (`Player_capture_premier_20260531T072112Z.log`, #338) supplied the REAL `draft_pack`/`draft_pick` Premier wire shapes, promoting both from FORMAT-CONFIRMED to REAL. The remaining FORMAT-CONFIRMED fixtures reflect the correct 2026.59.20 wire format as validated by:
1. The working Go parser tests that pass against the existing synthetic fixtures
2. Cross-reference with the logreader package source (match.go, draft_pick.go, collection.go, inventory.go, quests.go)

The next real-session capture (when a match or draft is played) should update these fixtures to REAL provenance. The drift canary (drift_canary_test.go) is designed to fire if the format changes between now and that update.

## Refresh Procedure (ADR-041 G3)

When the drift canary fires:
1. Open MTGA and play at least one match and one draft
2. Copy `Player.log` from `~/Library/Logs/Wizards Of The Coast/MTGA/`
3. Run the Python extraction script in `docs/runbooks/fixture-refresh.md` to re-extract and sanitize
4. Replace the fixture files in this directory
5. Update this MANIFEST with the new version and date
6. Submit a PR targeting `main` with Sarah security review on the fixture files

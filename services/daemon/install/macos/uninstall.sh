#!/usr/bin/env bash
# uninstall.sh — removes the VaultMTG daemon from macOS.
#
# Usage:
#   bash uninstall.sh
#
# Steps (ADR-022 Phase 2):
#   1. Unloads and disables the new launchd job (com.vaultmtg.daemon).
#   2. Unloads and disables the legacy launchd job (com.mtga-companion.daemon)
#      if still present — handles the upgrade-then-uninstall scenario.
#   3. Removes both plists from ~/Library/LaunchAgents/.
#   4. Removes the binary from /usr/local/bin/.

# was never loaded (e.g. running uninstall twice).

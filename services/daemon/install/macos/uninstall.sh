#

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Unload the launchd job.
# -w removes the Disabled key from the launch database so the job does not
# reload on next login even if the plist is present.
# We use `|| true` because `launchctl unload` exits non-zero when the job
# was never loaded (e.g. running uninstall twice).

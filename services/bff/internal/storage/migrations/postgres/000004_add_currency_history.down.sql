-- Rollback currency history table

-- CASCADE guards against incomplete later downs and dirty states. On a correct
-- sequential down, dependents are already gone before this migration runs;
-- CASCADE is a safety net for partial failures and future FK additions that
-- lack a corresponding down update.

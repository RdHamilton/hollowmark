## Conventions

- File naming: `NNNN-kebab-case-title.md`.
- Each ADR file starts with: `# ADR-NNNN: <title>`.
- Required front-matter fields (markdown headers, not YAML): `Status`, `Date`, `Decider`, `Context`, `Decision`, `Consequences`.
- Superseded ADRs link forward to the replacing ADR in their `Status` line.

## Adding a new ADR

1. Take the next 4-digit ID (next available is **0023**).
2. Copy an accepted ADR as a template (0018 is a clean recent one).
3. Fill in front-matter and submit a PR with `Status: Proposed`.
4. After review, flip `Status: Accepted` (or close the PR and write `Status: Rejected`).
5. Update this README index.

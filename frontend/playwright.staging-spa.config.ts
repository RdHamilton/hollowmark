/**
 * Playwright configuration for staging SPA browser smoke tests (#1933)
 *
 * Targets the live staging SPA at stg-app.vaultmtg.app using a real browser.
 * No webServer block — the staging SPA is already live.
 *
 * Run via:
 *   npm run test:e2e:staging-spa
 *   npx playwright test --config=playwright.staging-spa.config.ts
 *
 * Triggered by deploy-spa-staging.yml after a successful CloudFront invalidation.
 * Failures here must cause the deploy workflow post-step to fail.
 *
 * Required environment variables:
 *   STAGING_SPA_URL        — override the staging SPA base URL (optional)
 *   SMOKE_CLERK_EMAIL      — Clerk test account email (required for auth tests)
 *   SMOKE_CLERK_PASSWORD   — Clerk test account password (required for auth tests)
 *
 * Suite constraints:
 *   - 60 s per test timeout (increased from 30 s — CI networkidle too strict, see #1949)
 *   - Sequential (workers: 1) — avoids hammering staging with parallel sessions
 *   - No retries — staging instability should surface as a real failure
